# Load in the data
raw_data <- read_csv("~/Downloads/25w26-AllMetrics.csv")

# Create the days of the Week as a list
levels =  c("Sun", "Mon", 
  "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")


raw_data$`Jnys-PY` <- as.numeric(raw_data$`Jnys-PY`)

This is my data, I want to run a Chi Square test to see if there is any significant difference between the observed results of this year (Jnys) vs last year (Jnys-PY) for each of the different ticket types in (TicketType) "Freedom Disabled" "Zip 16+"          "Freedom Elderly"  "60+"              "Bus & Tram Pass"  "Travelcard"       "CPC"              "Oyster PAYG"      "Zip Child"       
[10] "Veterans"        


I also need to only check for ModeGroup == "Bus"
